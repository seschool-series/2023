                            Best Paper Awards, including a Distinguished Paper Award at ESEC/FSE 2019, and his work has attracted considerable attention. Before joining FEUP as a Full Professor, he was an Associate Professor at IST, ULisbon and a member of the 
                            Model-Based Reasoning group at PARC’s System and Sciences Laboratory and an Assistant Professor at the University of Porto. He has co-founded DashDash in January 2017, a platform to create web apps using only spreadsheet skills. The 
                            company has secured $9M in Series A funding in May 2018. He was a Visiting Researcher at Google NYC between 2019 and 2020, working on building systems and tools to increase the security of C/C++ codebases. He is currently a Research

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: On Making Software More Secure
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: In today’s world, where most companies are producing software to differentiate themselves, the pace of development has never been so important, and waiting to address software security vulnerabilities after 
                            completing development - as traditional pipelines would do - can be costly and introduce unnecessary risks. Static analysis is a powerful technique to detect issues early on the software development lifecycle (SDLC) - and shift security       
                            left - to decrease the costs associated with maintainable security since the technique can examine entire codebases without the need to compile and execute the code, i.e., it can be applied during the development phase. However, the scope 
                            of static analysis tools in security, or Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools, is vast and still difficult to understand since there is no structured way to classify, organize and compare these tools on different 
                            characteristics (e.g., techniques, programming languages, weakness spectra, performance, etc.) - which hinders the users’ trust and adoption. Building well-structured, real-world-based, and large datasets for testing those tools properly 
                            and fairly - to build users’ trust - is still challenging because of the lack of precise mining approaches and well-documented information. Better datasets are not only important for testing SAST tools but also for providing a ground 
                            truth to AI models to improve SAST tools with risk analysis, alert prioritization, and better representation of the issues found.

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: Security Testing of Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: RESTful APIs (or REST APIs for short) are becoming the standard technology to access web-oriented resources and to interconnect software systems across the public Internet. They operate on the web using 
                            the HTTP protocol, typically exchanging JSON payloads, and for this reason they are also known as Web APIs. Considering their dominant responsibility as cornerstone integration technology to interconnect different computer systems, 
                            it is crucial to reveal defects and vulnerabilities in their implementation as soon as possible. In fact, the security of the overall integrated system builds on top of the security and reliability of the atomic REST APIs that take 
                            part to the composition.
                            <br> In this talk, I will present a security testing approach to automatically detect and test mass assignment vulnerabilities. Mass assignment is one of the most prominent vulnerabilities in RESTful APIs. This vulnerability originates 
                            from a misconfiguration in common web frameworks, such that naming convention and automatic binding can be exploited by an attacker to craft malicious requests writing confidential resources and (massively) overriding data, that should 
                            be read-only and/or confidential.
                            <br> This approach has been implemented and evaluated on a set of case studies written in different programming languages. The evaluation highlights that the approach is quite effective in detecting seeded vulnerabilities, with a 
                            remarkably high accuracy.
