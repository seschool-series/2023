                            <strong>Session Title</strong>: Security Testing of Android Apps
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Android facilitates apps interoperation and integration through inter-process communication mechanism, by allowing an app to request a task from another app that is installed on the same device. However,
                            this interoperation mechanism poses security risks if an app does not implement it properly, such as permission re-delegation vulnerabilities, i.e., a form of privilege escalation where unprivileged malicious apps exploit vulnerable
                            privileged apps to take privileged actions on the attacker behalf.
                            <br> Static analysis techniques as well as run-time protections have been proposed to detect permission re-delegation vulnerabilities. However, as acknowledged by their authors, most of these approaches are affected by many
                            false positives because they do not discriminate between benign task requests and actual permission re-delegation vulnerabilities.
                            <br> In this talk, I will present a recent approach aiming at filling this gap and at bridging static and dynamic analysis with security testing for precise detection of permission re-delegation vulnerabilities. This approach
                            first groups a large set of benign and non-vulnerable apps into different clusters, based on their similarities in terms of functional descriptions. It then generates permission re-delegation model for each cluster, which characterizes
                            common permission re-delegation behaviors of the apps in the cluster. Given an app under test, this approach checks whether it has permission re-delegation behaviors that deviate from the model of the cluster it belongs to.
                            If that is the case, it generates test cases to detect the vulnerabilities, that show how the vulnerabilities can be exploited.
                            <br> Empirical validation suggests that this security testing approach outperforms state-of-the-art in terms of vulnerability detection precision.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: the process of verifying the identity of an individual based on their behavioral characteristics (keystroke, mouse, internet usage, etc.), has widely been used to secure access to the critical infrastructure
                            and the new generation devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, etc. Behavioral biometrics leverages machine learning to extract the users' digital behavioral signatures to profile them and use them for their identity verification.
                            Behavioral biometrics has shown to be advantageous in recent years because (i) of their ability to work passively in the background, (ii) they don't need any additional hardware, and (iii) their enhanced usability. Thus, behavioral
                            biometric-based authentication solutions have shown to be well accepted both in academia and in the industry, in recent years. The tutorial aims at covering the following topics in detail:

                            <strong>Session Title</strong>:Improving Software Security via Automatic Exploit Generation
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>:This talk describes the research arctivities that ahve been carrying out at DESSERT lab of Univ. di Napoli Federico II. The security of software paltforms and application depends upon effective techniques
                            to detect vulnerabilities commonly exploited by malicious attacks. Due to poor coding practices or human error, a known vulnerability discovered and patched in one code location may often exist in many other unpatched code
                            locations. Furthermore, patches are often error-prone, resulting in new vulnerabilities.
                            <br> The focus of this talk is on software offensive security, i.e., testing software security from an adversary perspective. In this light, the generation of effective software exploits is a fundamental step to validating
                            security controls, by discovering as many vulnerabilities as possible. Software exploit refers to a piece of software that can allow hackers to take control over a system, exploiting its vulnerabilities. The more effective
                            the generated exploits, the more vulnerabilities are discovered.
                            <br> Unfortunately, this is hard to achieve due to the limitation of scope, the access of penetration testers to the testing environment, tools used by the tester, and the available budget. To overcome the above limitations,
                            we envision an approach where the tester could write the exploit in a natural language and an “intelligent” engine can translate the exploit description into a real and effective software exploit.
                            <br> The second part of talk will present a project that aims to automatically generate attack scenarios in the form of emulation plans suitable for any open source adversary emulation tool, with the purpose of performing red
                            team exercises without the need of highly specialized personnel. The main idea consists of taking advantage of threat and incident reports, along with open Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) data, as sources to extract information
                            on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) [NIST SP 800-150] used by known APTs , together with other observable data and the operational flow underneath the opponent's strategy. The information gathered from all these sources
                            will then be converted into a structured format. The approach aims to make easier the design process of an emulation plan, allowing operators to invest time in testing activities rather than planning ones. Introducing an easy
                            way to test a system against several attack scenarios improves the resilience and defense mechanisms of a system, along with the ability to spot atypical activities and the awareness regarding risks and security controls fully
                            embracing intelligence driven defense approach.

                            University of Innsbruck, Austria. She has received her Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Innsbruck, Austria (2019) and her Master’s degree in Information Systems from the University of Münster, Germany
                            (2012). Her research interests span empirical and theoretical perspectives on security, privacy, digital currencies, and payment systems, with a strong focus on economic, human, behavioural, and social aspects. She is particularly
                            interested in interdisciplinary and multi-method research, at the frontier between computer science, information systems, economics, and the social sciences. Svetlana regularly serves as an Associate Editor and PC member at
                            the renowned International and European Conferences on Information Systems (ICIS, ECIS) and the Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS). Prior to her Ph.D. studies, she worked as a senior IT consultant in a
                            management consultancy in Germany.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Abstract</strong>: Game theory, the study of conflict situations and strategic decision making, has proved to be a valuable tool in economics, social and political sciences, evolutionary biology, psychology, or computer
                            science. The fundamental concepts, supported by proven mathematics, make game-theoretical approaches of interest in many cyber security and privacy research problems, too. Besides the most obvious attacker-defender scenario,
                            game theory can be applied to study economic incentives in such real-world examples as interdependent security or privacy, collaborative anonymity, or mandatory breach reporting. This session will introduce the basic notions,
                            elements, and solution concepts of game theory, supported by selected canonical games and examples from information security and privacy. In the second part, students will apply the learned game-theoretical apparatus, model
                            a given security problem as a game in group work, and discuss the strengths as well as limitations of game theory.
